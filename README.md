### About

We have three main questions.

**Has planting increased over time overall?  What about in low and high income areas?**

**Are the same types of trees being planted?  Do the proportions of native/evergreen/large trees differ across different incomes?**

**Do planted trees persist?  Which ones last a long time, and which ones die out after a few years?**

To answer these questions, we're using a dataset of street tree plantings provided by the Portland Parks & Recreation Department of Urban Forestry.  

Our final paper can be found [here](https://github.com/ds-civic-data/pdx-tree-planting/blob/master/documents/final_project.md).
