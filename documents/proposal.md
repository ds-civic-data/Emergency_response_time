## Proposal

### Theme

We will be analyzing the effectiveness of the Portland emergency response system by studying response times. Could there be a better metric for this?

### Questions

Does response time correlate with health outcomes? If so, how strong is the correlation?

What are the confounding variables that affect response time?

What does reponse time strictly mean? Hold time or time between call and arrival?

What does a good metric indicate? Shorter response time or less duplications?

### Describe the data

#### Source with citation
#### Data structure / size
#### Observational unit

Ideally, each observation would be one emergency call

#### Types of variables

We hope to have: wait time (numeric), health outcome (categorical), location (categorical)

#### Confidentiality/privacy concerns

Confidentiality is extremely relevant to this particular topic.  The data will probably include phone numbers or addresses, which might be connected to health outcomes.  It will be very important to protect the privacy of those recorded in the data set.

### Vision for deliverable

#### Visualizations
#### Models
#### Data
#### Format

The project deliverable will most likely be a whitepaper containing informative maps of Portland relating to the emergency response system.  It may end up being a Shiny app, however.
