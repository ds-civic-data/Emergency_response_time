## Proposal

### Theme

We will be studying Portland street trees, with a focus on nuisance and non-native trees.  We hope to compare the benefits and downsides of having trees that are not native to the Portland ecosystem.

### Questions

What percent of canopy cover is from non-native trees?  What about nuisance trees?

### Relevant work



### Contacts

### Describe the data

#### Source with citation
#### Data structure / size
#### Observational unit

Each observational unit is one planting of a Portland street tree.

#### Types of variables



#### Confidentiality/privacy concerns



### Vision for deliverable

#### Visualizations
#### Models
#### Data
#### Format

The project deliverable will most likely be a whitepaper containing informative maps of Portland relating to the presence of non-native or nuisance trees.  It may end up being a Shiny app, however.
