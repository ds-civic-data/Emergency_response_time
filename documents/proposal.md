## Proposal

### Theme

We will be studying Portland street trees, concentrating on nuisance and non-native trees.  We hope to compare the benefits and downsides of having trees that are not native to the Portland ecosystem.

### Questions

What percent of canopy cover is from non-native trees?  What about nuisance trees?

If we removed all of Portland's nuisance trees, how much canopy would we lose?  Who would be primarily affected?

Do some nuisance trees have upsides like edible fruit and nuts?

### Relevant work/resources

* [Urban Forest](https://www.portlandonline.com/portlandplan/?a=288088&c=52254) (city's canopy goals)

* [Citywide Systems & Infrastructure](https://www.portlandonline.com/portlandplan/index.cfm?c=52254&a=288093)

* [Portland Plant List](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/citycode/article/322280) (Ch. 4 has great information on nuisance plants)

* [Portland Nuisance Tree List](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/trees/article/514066)

### Vision for deliverable

#### Visualizations
#### Models
#### Data
#### Format

The project deliverable will most likely be a whitepaper containing informative maps of Portland relating to the presence of non-native or nuisance trees.  It may end up being a Shiny app, however.
