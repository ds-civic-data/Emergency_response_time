## Proposal

### Theme

We will be analyzing the effectiveness of the Portland emergency response system by studying response times.  Could there be a better metric for this?

### Questions

Does response time correlate with health outcomes? If so, how strongly is the correlation?

What are the confounding variables that affect response time?

What does reponse time strictly means? Hold time or time between call and arrival?

### Vision for deliverable

The project deliverable will most likely be a whitepaper containing informative maps of Portland relating to the emergency response system.  It may end up being a Shiny app, however.
